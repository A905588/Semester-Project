This is a C++ program that implements a school management system. The program uses classes and objects to store student information and attendance records. Here is a brief explanation of the code:

- The `student` class defines the attributes of a student, such as name, phone number, email, level, GPA, and index number.
- The `List` class defines the attributes of a list, such as index number and level.
- The `main` function is the entry point of the program. It initializes some variables and arrays, and then displays a menu with several options.
- If the user selects option 1, the program displays the total number of students and asks if the user wants to see their profiles.
- If the user selects option 2, the program allows the user to take attendance by entering the index number and level of each student. The attendance records are stored in an array of `List` objects.
- If the user selects option 3, the program displays all student profiles.
- If the user selects option 4, the program allows the user to add a new student to the system.
- If the user selects option 5, the program exits.
